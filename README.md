Team: Angelina Abi Daoud, Olivia Maddigan, and Madinakhon Sulaymonova  

## **Mission Statement**  

Our world is warming up, and we’re facing a global threat. Climate change is defined by extreme variations in meteorological factors such as temperature and weather patterns, which in turn disrupt the usual balance of nature. 

Our large interconnected freshwater system, the Great Lakes, are inevitably being impacted by climate change. The Great Lakes are located in the mid-east region between Canada and the United States, and they make up the largest basin of freshwater in the world. The five Great Lakes are Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. The Great Lakes are crucial to humankind as they account for around 20% of the world's surface freshwater. Ten million Canadians rely on the Great Lakes as a source of drinking water, for livelihood, and recreational purposes.

Adding to their importance, the Great Lakes are an ideal habitat for various wildlife and aquatic species, however; all of our homes are at risk due to climate change. 

The rising temperatures of the Great Lakes cause accelerated evaporation, which in turn causes water levels to decrease. When water levels decrease, the release of sediment-bound nutrients and toxins increases. The drop in water levels also causes decreased dissolved oxygen, especially during periods of ice cover, which is critical for marine flora and fauna. Additionally, warming waters create increased incidences of harmful algal blooms, lead to the decline of cold water species, and enable the success of invasive species. For instance, Zebra mussels have caused major disruptions in native fish populations among all of the Great Lakes. Exacerbating all of these issues is the fact that development and significant shoreline alterations have resulted in a loss of coastal biodiversity and ecological resilience. The shorelines act as a buffer for what enters the lacustrine ecosystem, therefore the deterioration of shoreline zones and wetlands increases the risk of harming the Great Lakes beyond repair.

First Nations Peoples have lived and coexisted with the Great Lakes ecosystem for millennia, pre-dating European settlers by thousands of years. Approximately 120 bands of Indigenous Peoples have occupied the Great Lakes basin over the course of history. A 2018 poll by the International Joint Commission showed that Indigenous respondents are more worried about the health and state of the Great Lakes than non-Indigenous respondents. Despite this, there has been an ongoing struggle for inclusion of Indigenous voices in water governance of the Great Lakes since at least 1972, when Canada and the United States signed the first Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Ongoing work is being done by scientists, such as Dr. Deborah McGregor, to highlight how external agencies, institutional researchers, and non-Indigenous individuals can support the meaningful engagement of Indigenous knowledge to protect our Great Lakes. CliMAKEChange believes that there is always more to learn as we strive for truth and reconciliation, and this education is vital for future Indigenous governance of the Great Lakes. Indigenous water governance will be essential to protect the future of our home’s “freshwater seas”.

“If you think that one person can't make a difference, that's not true, because if everybody felt that way we'll go nowhere. If everybody thought ‘my little piece can make a difference’, then cumulatively we make a massive difference.” - Dr. Gail Krantzberg

CliMAKEChange endeavors to make that difference. Through CliMAKEChange, we hope to raise awareness about the issues that our Great Lakes face in the wake of climate change, and to highlight the importance of Indigenous involvement in future management and conservation efforts in the Canadian context. Our app provides a historical comparison factor by bringing awareness through comparing indicators such as dissolved oxygen, surface lake temperatures, and ice cover which reflect climate change-related parameters that have been degrading our lakes. Not only should we try to reverse damage and protect future conservation of our Great Lakes, but a fundamental change in how the lakes are exploited for resources needs to occur if we are to save these ecological wonders for future generations. Join CliMAKEChange as we strive to change the future of our Great Lakes.

## **Canadian Lake Ontario Stress Index: App Description and Features**

The environment is under immense pressure due to climate change, especially sensitive ecosystems such as coastal wetlands. As a result, our Great Lakes are under a lot of stress. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) was conducted to determine how stressed the Canadian side of Lake Ontario is to raise awareness and inspire action. A Canadian Lake Ontario Stress Index was calculated based on parameters that were identified as stressful to local ecology and holistic health of Lake Ontario/Oniatarí:io : invasive species, water quality, sediment quality, marine shipping lanes, and monitored beaches. This index is displayed in conjunction with coastal wetlands to emphasize the relationship between the degradation of this sensitive habitat and our stressed coast. Major Canadian cities and First Nations communities are also displayed in the app to highlight the human relationship to this important freshwater treasure.

##### _What are AOCs?_   
This button defines AOCs (Areas of Concern) in the Great Lakes to provide context for the AOC Tour

##### _Areas of Concern (AOC) tour_    
This feature guides the user through a tour of Canada's 5 designated Areas of Concern along Lake Ontario. The tool includes each AOC clickable for the user, as the map zooms in to display Lake Ontario's stress around that AOC. The user can then click on the AOC symbol to learn more about why the area has been particularly vulnerable to environmental degradation.

##### _Wetlands Near Me?_    
Residents of the Lake Ontario watershed may not be aware that an integral ecosystem is in their backyards - coastal wetlands! This feature allows users to define a buffer radius around any address to view wetlands near them. Users are prompted to enter their address, enable their current location, or drop a pin to locate wetlands near them. The default search radius is 5 km, and user can scroll the bar to increase or decrease from 0 km to 15 km. This tool is meant for Lake Ontario residents to realize whether or not they live near a coastal wetland, which are extremely sensitive and ecologically diverse biogems that we must protect. This feature is meant to inspire action to protect your local wetland from the effects of climate change and urban development.

##### _Feature Summary_   
Users can display aggregate data on the side of the map as they scroll through and change extents to reveal: Number of Major Canadian Cities, Number of First Nations Communities, Number of Coastal Wetlands, and Number of AOCs within the map extent. This tool is useful to summarize the numbers of features shown on the map, especially considering how many wetlands there are.

##### _Explore the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Factors_   
Users can learn more about which factors went into the calculation of Lake Ontario's stress index. Most of these factors are available as layers in the Layers tool, so users can take a look at their prevalence within Lake Ontario region. The Stress Index Layer displays the calculated MDCA for Lake Ontario, taking into account dominant factors that leave our lake distressed.

## **Calculations**   

Calculations for the Canadian Lake Ontario Stress Index were done following a typical Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) procedure using a Pairwise Comparison Matrix, with the Weighted Overlay Tool. All calculations were made using Microsoft Excel and the Field Calculator in ArcGIS Pro Version 2.8.6.   
The Index was calculated using 8 indicators that were weighted and combined to form the index. The data from which the 8 factors were derived are outlined in detail in Table 3 of the “Geospatial Open Data Sources” section. 

Factors were selected based on a literature review of previous shoreline stress indices and data availability. Below is an explanation of the factors used:

Commercial Shipping Lanes - Shipping via large boats in the Great Lakes contributes to pollution, emissions, invasive species vulnerability, and disturbance of marine life. Proximity to these lanes is indicative of more stress.

Warming Temperature - Areas where the magnitude of mean annual Cumulative Degree Days (CDD, a measure of the cumulative temperature of one year) increased between 2000 and 2020, indicating a disproportional warming effect in the area. These areas are more prone to the effects of warming waters (evaporation, less dissolved oxygen, etc.) and contribute to overall stress.

Invasive Species Abundance - Incidences of documented invasive species sightings were mapped (zebra mussels, etc.) Proximity to high amounts of invasive species puts stress on the ecology of an area because invasive species compete with native species for resources, adding to the stress.

Coastal Road Density - One way to measure the relative development of a shoreline zone is to look at the abundance of roads in close proximity to the coast. The disturbance of shoreline zones contributes to the stress of the waters because the natural shoreline zone acts as a buffer for pollutants making their way to the water. Paving these areas deteriorates the natural buffer zone.

Water Quality - Proximity to locations with contaminant levels over the provincial safety limits indicates a polluted, stressed area.

Sediment Quality - Proximity to locations with contaminant levels over the provincial/federal safety limits indicates a polluted, stressed area.

Beach Closures - Incidence rate of public beach closures due to reasons like algae blooms or harmul bacteria are indicative of an area in distress.

Ice Cover Decrease - Areas where the mean annual percent ice cover decreased between 1980 and 2010.

The Canadian side of Lake Ontario was divided into equal sized strips to represent stress index zones, then nearshore zones were added to demonstrate the difference between open water and nearshore stress in Lake Ontario. The Euclidian Distance Tool was used to determine distances to commercial shipping lanes, invasive species sightings, coastal road density, areas with poor water and sediment quality, and beach closures. Raster surfaces were produced with the amount of change of CDD's and ice cover decrease for Lake Ontario). 

##### _Part 1 - Indicator Standardization_   

The rasters were all put through the Reclassify tool to reclassify the data on a scale of 1 - 20, with 1 being the most stressed and 20 being the least stressed. Equal Intervals were used for all datasets.   

##### Part 2 - Assigning weights and weight standardization   

Each indicator was assigned a weight reflective of its proportion to its influence using a Pairwise Comparison Matrix.

###### Table 1. Pairwise Comparison Matrix  
![alt text](https://github.com/omaddz/climakechange/blob/main/t1.png?raw=true) 

The composite weight for each indicator was calculated using the following formula, which was done in Microsoft Excel by Team McLakers:

Indicator Weight = (Factor Score1 * Eigenvalue1) + (Factor Score2 * Eigenvalue2) + (Factor Score3 * Eigenvalue3)

Once the indicator weights were calculated, they were standardized so the sum of all weightings equal 1, using this formula:

Standardized Indicator Weight = Indicator Weight / Sum of all Indicator Weights

##### Part 3 - Calculating the Canadian Lake Ontario Stress Index 

All of the reclassified rasters and their weights were loaded into the Weighted Overlay Tool. The output was the Stress Index surface. Zonal Statistics were used to determine the average stress for each of the stress index zones previously created.
